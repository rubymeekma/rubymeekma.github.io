        <p>The Wānaka Festival of Colour is a biennial celebration of arts and performance set in the heart of the Southern Lakes. Ahead of the 2025 festival, I worked closely with the team to refresh their visual identity — responding to feedback that their existing palette felt flat and disconnected from the region’s creative energy. Together, we developed a vibrant new colour system that better reflected the personality of Wānaka and the festival’s bold, inclusive spirit. <br> <br>  The design work spanned a wide range of festival materials, including posters, brochures, booklets, crew passes, signage, digital assets, and ongoing Webflow website management and content updates. <br> <br>

        <p>Cokoha is a platform app developed by Community Koha that empowers communities in Aotearoa to share and exchange resources with a simple tap. In the lead-up to its launch, I worked with the team at Manawa Māori to design a suite of bilingual marketing materials, including a brochure, flyer and poster. <br> <br> The resources were created to resonate with a wide range of communities across Aotearoa, while reinforcing Cokoha’s identity as a Māori-owned and led initiative. Te reo Māori was thoughtfully integrated alongside English to celebrate language revitalisation and encourage meaningful engagement through connection and generosity. <br> <br>

            <p>Manawa Māori, Aotearoa's leading provider of reo Māori services, needed a new website to accommodate growing demand. Working closely within our tīma, we started fresh and developed a brand new platform, integrating a refreshed brand identity to enhance user experience and accessibility.

The result is a more in-depth learning experience for users, making it easier for them to explore our offerings and learn more about Manawa Māori as a whole.

        </div> 

            <p>Clay Week Nelson 2024, an eagerly anticipated celebration of ceramic artistry in Nelson, Aotearoa, required a captivating online platform to showcase its diverse workshops and ignite enthusiasm for the festival. Collaborating closely with the event organisers, a visually engaging website was crafted to embody the essence of creativity and community that defines Clay Week Nelson.<br> <br> Drawing from the festival's brand identity and inspired by old school NZ Potter magazines, a fresh and cohesive visual narrative was woven into the site, ensuring it resonates deeply with its audience. The goal was to create an intuitive and immersive experience that not only informs visitors about the workshops and events but also captures the vibrant spirit driving Clay Week Nelson.

The website is incredible and she is so efficient to work with.”

        </div> 

            <p>As part of Ocean Design's Panana Programme, we worked on a non-live client project to create a new Visual Identity for Greengrower Vertical Farming right here in Aotearoa. Individually, we applied our refresh to various applications and worked closely with the client to learn every step of the design process from Ocean's perspective. 
            <br> <br> My concept’s core focus was on fostering approachability and trust among consumers. Aiming to bridge the gap between innovative agricultural practices and consumer understanding. This narrative emphasises the idea that despite being perceived as new or unconventional, Greengrower’s initiatives are ultimately for the people and the planet. Each visual element was driven by these key ideas and the approach ensures a coherent, consistent and reliable brand voice. <br> <br>

            <h4> Eight Mile Road</h4>
            <h5>[2023] Editorial</h5> 

        </div> 

            <p>Eight Mile Road is a response to the 2023 ISTD Brief ‘Mapping the World’. <br> <br>

                This piece focussed specifically on the 2010 Detroit Census racial dot map. The map shows how much the United States remains segregated by race. Each book typographically represents either side of Eight Mile Road and tells a story of what life is like for residents living there. <br> <br>
                
                I selected different paper stocks for each book to ensure the divide between the two was clear. The North side being a rich, cream off white shade and the South being a more gritty and gloomy grey. They were connected by a handmade hard cover to ensure that the reader could read the spreads together. <br> <br>

            <p>In Short was a concept I created with the brief of creating a news website. I designed In Short with the intention of making a quick, simple and minimal website that is straight to the point as well as flowing easily for the user.<br> <br> The target audience was for people like myself, want to know whats going on but claim they "don't have the time". 
                
                I kept a brutalist theme throughout to keep it clear and simple. Alongside the fact that it was inspired by quite literally, being In Short. <br> <br>

            <p>Inception wooooo! I couldn’t not include this one. I have to preface, if there is something that is not functioning correctly on this website that will be because I coded it myself. I do not consider myself a developer in any way shape or form, I just had a vision for my portfolio and wanted a fun personal project to keep my designer brain busy during the break.<br> <br>

            Looking back, it did take me a solid four weeks alongside some blood, sweat and tears (and lots of help) but it’s done! Even the buttons work too... very proud of that. Overall, it was a very rollercoaster, informative experience and I learnt a lot about myself and how I will never pursue a career in coding... and will probably use a template next time.  <br> <br>
