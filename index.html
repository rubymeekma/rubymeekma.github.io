            <p>Motivated and inspired by simple, strong and striking aesthetics, for the past four years at university I have applied my design thinking across various mediums. 
            <br> <br>
             I have worked on multiple projects that explore the world of digital, product, identity, editorial, typographic, human-centred and service design (to name a few) and have loved almost every minute of it. 
            <br> <br>
            I thrive in environments surrounded by others with passion and empathy and am consistently driven to design for good, for the future and for the people.
            My ultimate goal is to continue doing what I love whilst learning as much as possible along the way!</p>

            <h4> Eight Mile Road</h4>
            <h5>Editorial Design</h5> 

        </div> 

            <p>Eight Mile Road is a response to the 2023 ISTD Brief ‘Mapping the World’. <br> <br>

                This piece focussed specifically on the 2010 Detroit Census racial dot map. The map shows how much the United States remains segregated by race. Each book typographically represents either side of Eight Mile Road and tells a story of what life is like for residents living there. <br> <br>
                
                I selected different paper stocks for each book to ensure the divide between the two was clear. The North side being a rich, cream off white shade and the South being a more gritty and gloomy grey. They were connected by a handmade hard cover to ensure that the reader could read the spreads together. <br> <br>

        <p>A personal project of promotional posters created for a student-led initiative Tahi Rua Toru Whā at Massey University Wellington, NZ. <br> <br>

            This initiative picked up from a group of students wanting to increase the connectivity of the year groups within our particular design degree. We added the element of weekly ‘Happy hour help sesh’s’ where we hang around the first, second and third year space on a Friday to help or hang with anyone who needs it! <br> <br>

            <p>Twenty Typefaces that Changed the World is a book following the third year Editorial Brief. We were asked to select twenty typefaces that we believe have changed the World in some way and present it in a book format. <br> <br> We were supplied the content and had free reign of how we would tell/show the story of each typeface and it's place in the world. My book was hand-made and bound using fast back binding. <br> <br>

            <h5>Digital Design</h5>

            <p>In Short was a concept I created with the brief of creating a news website. I designed In Short with the intention of making a quick, simple and minimal website that is straight to the point as well as flowing easily for the user.<br> <br> The target audience was for people like myself, want to know whats going on but claim they "don't have the time". 
                
                I kept a brutalist theme throughout to keep it clear and simple. Alongside the fact that it was inspired by quite literally, being In Short. <br> <br>

            <p>Inception wooooo! I couldn’t not include this one. I have to preface, if there is something that is not functioning correctly on this website that will be because I coded it myself. I do not consider myself a developer in any way shape or form, I just had a vision for my portfolio and wanted a fun personal project to keep my designer brain busy during the break.<br> <br>

            Looking back, it did take me a solid four weeks alongside some blood, sweat and tears (and lots of help) but it’s done! Even the buttons work too... very proud of that. Overall, it was a very rollercoaster, informative experience and I learnt a lot about myself and how I will never pursue a career in coding... and will probably use a template next time.  <br> <br>
